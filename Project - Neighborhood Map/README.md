This is the neighbor hood map project for my neighborhood.

To begin, unzip the folder and oepn the file main.html in your favorite browser.

From here you can enjoy exploring the provided locations either by clicking on them for more information or by searching through the filtered list on the left hand side of the page.

Google Maps Api is the main part of this page and functions just like the application, just minus a few of the bells and whistles.

Finally, Knockout.JS is the glue that ties it all together into a functioning and exciting app.

Enjoy!
